## Compatibility With Other Extensions

It is possible to combine this extension with other cursor movement extensions.

You can use the `inRegionMode` context flag in the `when` clause of your keybind to provide different behaviour for region mode vs. cursor mode. The default keybinds are laid out as follows:

```json
{
    "key": "DESIRED KEY",
    "command": "CURSOR MOVE COMMAND",
    "when": "editorTextFocus && !inRegionMode"
},
{
    "key": "DESIRED KEY",
    "command": "CURSOR MOVE & SELECT COMMAND",
    "when": "editorTextFocus && inRegionMode"
}
```
